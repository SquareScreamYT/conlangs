## Info

Umbarillic (Kozramva: Uṽarʉila Raṽa, Umbarillic: Ubaruila Raba) is a language in the Nanu-Keezhu language family. It is closely related to Kozramva, spoken to the North, although it is not mutually intelligible.

## Phonology

### Consonants

|             | Bilabial | Palatalised Bilabial | Alveolar | Palatal    | Velar      | Glottal |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|----------|------------|------------|---------|
| Nasal       | m        | mʲ \<mj>             | n        | ɲ \<ń>     | ŋ \<q>     |         |
| Plosive     | p b      | pʲ bʲ \<pj bj>       | t d      | c          | k g        |         |
| Fricative   | β \<v>   | βʲ \<vj>             | s z      | ɕ ʑ \<ś ź> | x ɣ \<x ǵ> | h       |
| Approximant | w        |                      | l        |            |            |         |
| Trill       |          |                      | r        |            |            |         |
| Lateral     |          |                      | ɬ \<ł>   |            |            |         |

Consonants can be geminated, but this is restricted to a certain subset of consonants, which excludes palatalised and palatal consonants and [h]. Consonants outside this set are never geminated. Gemination is represented in orthography by doubling the consonant grapheme.

The main differences from Kozramva are:

* Prenasalised fricatives become voiced stops
* Retroflex consonants become palatal
* [ɭ] becomes [ɬ]
* [ⁿr] merges with [r]

### Vowels

|      | Front | Central | Back |
|------|-------|---------|------|
| High | i     | ɨ \<y>  | u    |
| Mid  | e     |         | o    |
| Low  |       | a       |      |

* Umbarillic has a phonological contrast between short and long vowels, vowel lengthening is presented in orthography with an acute (á, ý, é, etc).
* Sequences of two short vowels in hiatus of identical quality are realised as a long vowel, e.g. /i.i/ [i:].

### Phonotactics

Umbarillic is (C)V(G), where:

* C is any consonant
* V is any vowel, regardless of length
* G is the first half of a geminated consonant

## Phonology

### Consonants

|             | Bilabial | Palatalised Bilabial | Alveolar | Palatal         | Velar        | Glottal |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| Nasal       | m        | mʲ \<mi>             | n        | ɲ \<ni>         | ŋ \<ng>      |         |
| Plosive     | p b      | pʲ bʲ \<pi bi>       | t d      | c               | k g          |         |
| Affricate   |          |                      |          | tɕ \<cz>        |              |         |
| Fricative   | β \<w>   | βʲ \<wi>             | s z      | ɕ ʑ \<sz zs/rz> | x ɣ \<ch gi> | h       |
| Approximant | w \<ł>   |                      | l        | ʎ \<li>         |              |         |
| Trill       |          |                      | r        |                 |              |         |

Consonants can be geminated, but this is restricted to a certain subset of consonants, which excludes palatalised and palatal consonants except [c], [ŋ], [x], [ɣ] and [h]. Consonants outside this set are never geminated. Gemination is represented in orthography by doubling the consonant grapheme.

The main differences from Kozramva are:

* Prenasalised fricatives become voiced stops
* Retroflex consonants become palatal
* [ⁿr] merges with [r]

### Vowels

|      | Front | Central | Back |
|------|-------|---------|------|
| High | i     | ɨ \<y>  | u    |
| Mid  | e     |         | o    |
| Low  |       | a       |      |

* Chielbaric Kozramva has a phonological contrast between short and long vowels, vowel lengthening is presented in orthography with an acute (á, ú, é, etc). [ɨ] cannot be lengthened.
* Sequences of two short vowels in hiatus of identical quality are realised as a long vowel, e.g. /i.i/ [i:].
* Sequences of of palatalised consonants and /i/ are pronounced as [Ciː]
* final /Cɨ/ can be realised as [C] and can be written without the \<y>, final [ʑ] is written as \<zs> everywhere and \<rz> word-finally.

### Phonotactics

Chielbaric Kozramva is (C)V(G), where:

* C is any consonant
* V is any vowel, regardless of length
* G is the first half of a geminated consonant

### Consonant Mutation

Chielbaric Kozramva features consonant mutation. There are 3 grades of consonant mutation: Radical, Spirantised and Geminated. Individual morphemes may trigger either spirantisation, gemination or none at all of an immediately following consonant, the type of mutation present being lexically specified for each morpheme. The three types of mutation are typically annotated with a superscript r, s, or g respectively, e.g. kakkoaˢ “leaf”, which triggers spirantisation on a following suffix (eg. *nannawiᵍ* "rice-ABL"). The following table shows the states of the consonants undergoing mutation. Empty cells represent that the mutated form is the same as the radical form.

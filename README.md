### Phonotactics

This conlang follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, where:

* C (the consonant) can be any consonant.
* V (the vowel) can be any vowel.
* n (the nasal) is optional and can appear only at the end of a syllable.
* Each word can only have 1 to 4 syllables, except for proper nouns which can have any amount of syllables as needed.
* final [n] may not occur before [n] or any vowel.
* [wu] and [ji] are invalid syllables.

Examples of Valid Words (excluding proper nouns):

* po
* tan
* luna
* kunme

Examples of Invalid Words:

* sik
* flec
* tunna
* hahihuheho

### Orthography

* [ts] is written as "c"

Logography:

#### Capitalisation

Start of sentences and proper nouns are capitalised.

### Allophones

* The letter "n" is written as "n" before [k] or [g] and is pronounced as [ŋ].
* The letter "n" is written as "m" before [p] or [b] and is pronounced as [m].

### Word Coining

#### Notes

* Each noun, adjective, adverb or verb base can only have 2 syllables. 1 syllable words are limited to conjuctions, pronouns and interjections. 3 to 4 syllables are for the final conjugated form of nouns and verbs.

#### Deriving Words

1. Start by obtaining a word (typically from a Germanic or Slavic language). For this example we will use the root word for "to duck" in German: "tauch".
2. Turn all voiced phonemes to their voiceless counterparts. Change all rhotic consonants to l or w.
3. The word "tauch" can be written in Nimine's orthography as "tauk". However, it does not fit the phonotactics.
4. First, merge diphthongs into a monophthong. Most of the time, take the 2 vowels and mark the middle of it (eg. e and o gives ə) then fing the closest vowel. Here are the most used ones:
   * ai -> e
   * au -> o
   * oi -> e
   * ə, ɛ -> e
   * ɔ, ø -> o
   * ɨ, y -> i
   * ʌ, ɐ -> a
   * ɯ, ʉ -> u
5. Secondly, do the same for consonants.
6. Then, you take any final nasal and turn it into "n", unless the base word is one letter, then you would do nasal + "e".
7. Take the first consonant of a cluster and use it. Remove any extra syllables from the end of a word. If the word ends with a consoannt and it is still under 2 syllables, add an "e". We now have "toke".
8. Change "ia" or "ua" to "ija" and "uwa". Do this for every diphthong that starts with i or u.
9. Congratulations! You made a word.

## Grammar

**Nimine uses V2 word order. Example:**

Un sehete hujinla  
1SG see.PST dog.PL  
I saw dogs

Coten sehete un hujinla  
yesterday see.PST 1SG dog.PL  
Yesterday I saw dogs

**Adjectives and adverbs come before nouns and verbs. Example:**

losi hunto  
big dog

seko hunto  
fast dog

pisa konen  
quickly run

**Nimine uses suffixes to mark plurality of nouns. Example:**

hunto   
dog.SG

huntolo  
dog.DU

huntola  
dog.PL

**Nimine uses suffixes to mark the tense of verbs. Example:**

sehete  
see.PST

seheme  
see.PRS

seheke  
see.FUT

**Nimine also uses suffixes for helping verbs. Example:**

Un sehema hunto  
1SG see.PRS.NEG dog  
I am not seeing a dog  
\* it changes the e in suffixes to an a, if there is no suffix it adds -ja

Un sehemi hunto  
1SG see.PRS.POSB dog  
I might be seeing a dog  
\* it changes the e in suffixes to an i, if there is no suffix it adds -wi

Un sehemo hunto  
1SG see.PRS.ABIL dog  
I can see a dog  
\* it changes the e in suffixes to an o, if there is no suffix it adds -jo

**Nimine allows you to change words into different parts of speech. Example:**

pisa

pisazu  
speed  
\* It will turn any part of speech into a noun, same with others.

pisalu  
speed (verb)  
\* It will turn any part of speech into a verb.

pisatu

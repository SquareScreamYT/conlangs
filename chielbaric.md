### Consonants

Phonemes are written in the International Phonetic Alphabet. Voiceless consonants are on the left and voiced on the right. The orthography is written in Cyrillic, which is enclosed in angle brackets `<>`. For ease of typing, please use [this site](https://sq.is-a.dev/conlangs/chielbaric_kb) to type characters.

### Vowels

|            | Front      | Central | Back    |
|------------|------------|---------|---------|
| Close      | i y \<и ю> | ɨ \<ы>  | u \<у>  |
| Near-Close | ɪ \<і>     |         | ʊ \<ı>* |
| Close-Mid  | e ø \<е ё> |         | o \<о>  |
| Mid        |            | ə \<э>  |         |
| Open-Mid   | ɛ œ \<я є> |         |         |
| Open       |            | ä \<а>  |         |

*[ʊ] can be inserted between consonant clusters deemed impossible. It is written as a short vertical stroke, like \<ы> without the \<ь>. \<ı> can be used as a substitute. There is no capital form as it is typically omitted, and can be added anywhere the writer fancies.

Some vowels can be lengthened. It is marked with an acute `´`.

|           | Front        | Central | Back    |
|-----------|--------------|---------|---------|
| Close     | iː yː \<и́ ю́> |         | uː \<у́> |
| Close-Mid | eː øː \<е́ э́> |         | oː \<о́> |
| Open-Mid  | ɛ œ \<я́ є́>   |         |         |
| Open      |              | äː \<а́> |         |

## Grammar

### Root Classes

Roots are made of 2 consonants. Vowels can be placed next to or between these consonants to specify the meaning of the root.

Nouns are the simplest forms of roots. There are 12 classes of vowels for noun roots:

* *`и [i]`* Null: None of something.
* *`ю [y]`* Singular: One of something.
* *`у [u]`* Dual: Two of something.

* *`а [ä]`* Mass: Used for uncountable, masses or all instances of something in existence.

### Root Representation

Root representation is divided into 3 parts: **Onticity**, **Modality**, and **Medium**.

#### Onticity

Onticity refers to the realness of the object. There are 4 possible variations of onticity:

* `ACT` Actual: actual, real, physically existing.
* `PRC` Perceived: perceived, appears real but uncertain.
* `HYP` Hypothetical: hypothetical, fictional, potentially existing or imaginary.
* `NXS` Nonexistent: nonexistent, false, fake or impossible.

#### Modality

Modality refers to the way the object is accessed. There are 5 modalities:

* `VIS` Visual: seen.
* `AUD` Auditorial: heard.
* `TAC` Tactile: felt.
* `OLF` Olfactory: smelt/tasted.
* `MUL` Multimodal: a combination of the above.

#### Medium

Medium refers to the way the object is represented. There are 6 mediums:

* `PHY` Physical: physical.
* `VRB` Verbal: verbal (speech/sign language).
* `TXT` Text: written.
* `GRA` Graphical: graphical (drawing, picture, painting).
* `VIR` Virtual: digital, virtual or electronic.
* `CPT` Conceptual: conceptual, an idea or no medium is present.

|         | PHY | VRB | TXT | GRA | VIR | CPT |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| ACT.VIS | мп  | тп  | сп  | мб  | дб  | зб  |
| ACT.AUD | нп  | хп  | шп  | нб  | ғб  | жб  |
| ACT.TAC | ӷп  | кп  | пг  | ӷб  | ґб  | бг  |
| ACT.OLF | ңп  | пъ  | лп  | ңб  | бъ  | лб  |
| ACT.MUL | пп  | пф  | рп  | бб  | бв  | рб  |
| PRC.VIS | мт  | тт  | ст  | мд  | дд  | зд  |
| PRC.AUD | нт  | хт  | шт  | нд  | ғд  | жд  |
| PRC.TAC | ӷт  | кт  | тг  | ӷд  | ґд  | дг  |
| PRC.OLF | ңт  | тъ  | лт  | ңд  | дъ  | лд  |
| PRC.MUL | пт  | фт  | рт  | бд  | дв  | рд  |
| HYP.VIS | мс  | тц  | сс  | мз  | дѕ  | ѕз  |
| HYP.AUD | нс  | хс  | шс  | нз  | ғз  | жз  |
| HYP.TAC | ӷс  | кс  | сг  | ӷз  | ґз  | зг  |
| HYP.OLF | ңс  | съ  | лс  | ңз  | зъ  | лз  |
| HYP.MUL | пс  | сф  | рс  | зз  | зв  | рз  |
| NXS.VIS | мк  | тк  | ск  | мґ  | дґ  | зґ  |
| NXS.AUD | нк  | хк  | шк  | нґ  | ғґ  | жґ  |
| NXS.TAC | ӷк  | кк  | кг  | ӷґ  | ґґ  | ґг  |
| NXS.OLF | ңк  | къ  | лк  | ңґ  | ґъ  | лґ  |
| NXS.MUL | пк  | фк  | рк  | бґ  | ґв  | рґ  |

Representation is typically structure as `OM` where O is Onticity and M is Modality/Medium. For example:

* A fake digital photo would be: *`сҙ [sð̞]`* NXS-VIS–VIR
* A hypothetical object described in a story would be: *`ср [sɾ]`* HYP–VIS–TXT
* A real spoken message would be: *`пз [pz]`* ACT–AUD–VRB
* A sculpture would be: *`пб [pb]`* ACT–VIS–PHY

### Root Construction

To construct a noun, select the root, class and number. For this example, we will use the root *`р-ң-л`* "apple".

Nouns typically follow the pattern `1CN23R`, where 1, 2 and 3 are the consonants in the root, C is the class, N is the number, and R is the representation.

To say "apple blossom", the class is *`э [ə]`* IV: Animate.

If there is a pair of apple blossoms, the number used is *`у [u]`* Dual.

Since it is a real picture, the representation is *`пх [px]`* ACT–VIS–GRA.

The result is *`рэуңлпх [ɾəuŋlpx]`*, meaning "a graphical representation of a pair of apple blossoms". This can be glossed as `apple.ANIM.DU.ACT-VIS-GRA`

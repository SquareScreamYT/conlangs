### Consonants

Phonemes are written in the International Phonetic Alphabet. Voiceless consonants are on the left and voiced on the right. The orthography is written in Cyrillic, which is enclosed in angle brackets `<>`. For ease of typing, please use [this site](https://sq.is-a.dev/conlangs/chielbaric_kb) to type characters.

### Phonotactics

(C)(C)V(V)(C)(C) where:

* C is any consonant
* V is any vowel

### Allophony

* Voiceless stops [p] [t] [k] are unaspirated unless followed by [h]. *`пг тг кг [pʰ tʰ kʰ]`*
* [ɾɾ] can be realised as [r].
* Consonants can be palatalised if followed by [j]. *`пй сй рй [pʲ sʲ ɾʲ]`*
* Consonants can be labialised if followed by [w]. *`бў шў фў [bʷ ʃʷ fʷ]`*
* This also applies to [ɥ] and [ɨ̯]. *`ҙю̆ ԯы̆ [ð̞ᶣ ɬʴ]`*
* Consonants can be aspirated and palatalised if followed by [ç]. *`пь ть кь [pʰʲ tʰʲ kʰʲ]`*
* Consonants can be glottalised if followed by [ʔ]. *`дъ цъ лъ [dˀ t͡sˀ lˀ]`*
* Voiced sonorants may be devoiced if preceded by [h]. *`гм гн грр [m̥ n̥ r̥]`*

## Grammar

### Root Classes

Roots are made of 2 consonants. Vowels can be placed next to or between these consonants to specify the meaning of the root.

Nouns are the simplest forms of roots. There are 12 classes of vowels for noun roots:

**Bold**: Root Word

#### I: Base *`а [a]`*

Base: The root word.

#### II: Fractal *`я [ɛ]`*

Fractal: Something that webs out, branches out, or is interconnected.

* Branching **Apple** > Apple Tree
* Branching **Rocks** > Cave
* Web of a **Night Sky** > Universe, Cosmos
* Interconnected **Towers** > City

#### III: Instantaneous *`о [o]`*

Instantaneous: Something that is instant, fast.

* Instant **Coffee** > Instant Coffee
* Instant **Flight** > Teleportation
* Fast **Book** > Downloaded Item
* Instant **Chicken** > Frozen Chicken (Ease of access)
* Fast **Vegetables** > Fresh Vegetables (Quickly harvested)

#### IV: Animate *`э [ə]`*

Animate: Typically the same as the root word, otherwise something that is alive.

* Living **Apple** > Apple Blossom (Before the apple is picked)
* Living **Trip** > Migration (People moving)

* **Weight** Tool > Hammer, Mace
* **Book** Construct > Shelf, Bookcase
* **Store** Construct > Market

These are the vowels used for each of the classes:

1. *`а [a]`* `BASE` Base
2. *`я [ɛ]`* `FRAC` Fractal
3. *`о [o]`* `INST` Instantaneous
4. *`э [ə]`* `ANIM` Animate
5. *`ё [ø]`* `SLOW` Slow-Animate
6. *`е [e]`* `HOL` Hollow
7. *`у [u]`* `AUG` Extensive/Augmentative
8. *`ы [ɨ]`* `FLD` Fluid
9. *`ю [y]`* `QLTY` Quality
10. *`и [i]`* `DIM` Diminutive
11. *`а́ [aː]`* `MATL` Material
12. *`о́ [oː]`* `CONSTR` Construct

### Root Numbers

There are 8 numbers that roots have to conform to. These are:

* *`и [i]`* Null: None of something.
* *`ю [y]`* Singular: One of something.
* *`у [u]`* Dual: Two of something.
* *`е [e]`* Paucal: Several of something (less than 10).
* *`ё [ø]`* Plural: Multiple of something (more than 10).
* *`о [o]`* Collective: A collective or group of something (group or more than 100).
* *`я [ɛ]`* Umbral: An unknown or unspecified number of something. Use this if unsure.
* *`а [a]`* Mass: Used for uncountable, masses or all instances of something in existence.

### Root Construction

To construct a noun, select the root, class and number. For this example, we will use the root *`р-ң`* "apple".

Nouns typically follow the pattern `1CN2`, where 1 and 2 are the consonants in the root, C is the class and N is the number.

To say "apple blossom", the class is *`э [ə]`* IV: Animate.

If there is a pair of apple blossoms, the number used is *`у [u]`* Dual.

The result is *`рэуң [ɾəuŋ]`*, meaning "a pair of apple blossoms". This can be glossed as `apple.ANIM.DU`

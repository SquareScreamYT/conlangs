The orthography is written in Cyrillic, which are enclosed in angle brackets `<>`. For ease of typing, please use [this site](https://sq.is-a.dev/conlangs/chielbaric_kb) to type characters.

### Phonotactics

(C)(C)V(C)(C) where:

* C is any consonant

### Allophony

* Voiceless stops [p] [t] [k] are unaspirated unless followed by [h]. *`пг тг кг [pʰ tʰ kʰ]`*
* [ɾɾ] can be realised as [r].
* Consonants can be palatalised if followed by [j]. *`пй сй рй [pʲ sʲ ɾʲ]`*
* Consonants can be labialised if followed by [w]. *`бў шў фў [bʷ ʃʷ fʷ]`*
* This also applies to [ɥ] and [ɨ̯]. *`ҙю̆ ԯы̆ [ð̞ᶣ ɬʴ]`*
* Consonants can be aspirated and palatalised if followed by [ç]. *`пь ть кь [pʰʲ tʰʲ kʰʲ]`*
* Consonants can be glottalised if followed by [ʔ]. *`дъ цъ лъ [dˀ t͡sˀ lˀ]`*
* Voiced sonorants may be devoiced if preceded by [h]. *`гм гн грр [m̥ n̥ r̥]`*
